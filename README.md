## Project: Pens and Printers Data Analysis on Sales

The company Pens And Printers had a problem with their customer focus, so I analyze the projects oriented to brainstorming.
* Data was taken from the "product_sles.csv" archive.
* It includes thw whole cleaning process of the dataset, with imputation of NaN values, standarization  and data quality improvement.
* For the questions that they asked me to solve, I used visualization with Seaborn and MatPlotLib.
* With pandas I performed both the Exploratory Data Analysis and the import & cleaning data processes.
* I used hypothesis tests and ANOVA tests to determine the best way to deploy offers and product sales in the company.
